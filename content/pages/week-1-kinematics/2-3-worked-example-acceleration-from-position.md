A runner travels along the x-axis, and at time \\(\\displaystyle t=0 \\) is at the origin. The \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner's position with respect to the origin is given by:

\\(\\displaystyle x(t)=bt^2 \\)

where \\(\\displaystyle b \\) is a positive constant.

**(Part a)** What are the units of the constant \\(\\displaystyle b \\)? Express your answer in terms of m for meter and s for seconds.

**(Part b)** Find \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\), the \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner's velocity as a function of time.

**(Part c)** Find \\(\\displaystyle a(t) \\), the \\(\\displaystyle x \\)-component of the runner's acceleration as a function of time.

**(Part d)** Do a plot of \\(\\displaystyle x(t) \\), \\(\\displaystyle v(t) \\) and \\(\\displaystyle a(t) \\) vs. time.
