![A diagram showing the projectile gun's position relative to the apple hanging on the tree.](BASEURL_PLACEHOLDER/resources/week1ps1_3)

An apple is suspended a height \\(\\displaystyle h \\) above the ground. A physics demo instructor has set up a projectile gun a horizontal distance \\(\\displaystyle d \\) away from the apple. The projectile is initially a height \\(\\displaystyle s \\) above the ground. The demo instructor fires the projectile with an initial velocity of magnitude \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\) just as the apple is released. Find \\(\\displaystyle \\theta \_0 \\), the angle at which the projectile gun must be aimed in order for the projectile to strike the apple. Ignore air resistance.
