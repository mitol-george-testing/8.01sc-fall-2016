In the figure, pulley A is fixed to the ceiling. An ideal rope is attached at one end to block 1 of mass \\(m\_1\\), it passes around a second pulley, labelled B, and its other end is fixed to the ceiling. A second ideal rope attaches pulley B to a second block of mass \\(m\_2\\). As a result, pulley B and block 2 move together.

The goal of the problem is to calculate the accelerations of blocks 1 and 2.

The solution of this problem is divided into four parts:

*   Part I : Set up the system of equations.
*   Part II: Constraint condition - find the relationship between the accelerations.
*   Part III: Constraint condition using a virtual displacement argument.
*   Part IV: Solving the system of equations.

The video below will help you to set up the equations needed to answer the question.
